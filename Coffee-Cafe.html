	<p class="introText">On Februrary 12, it is a new start for the four of us. Leaving everything else behind, we finally gotten our first own franchise coffee shop approval. As all of us still couldn't snap out of this dream sometimes ago, we still thought getting the warrant approval is impossible. But, it was just too true that we can finally succeed in our new life goal moreover so. Which is why to kickstart eveything, we spend a lot of effort in furnishing and decorating our first coffee shop hoping that it will be smoothly sail until a new checkpoint.</p>

        <p class="introText">The first method of selling coffee we tried was enjoyable but <span> class="blue">short-lived:</span><br><br>We would call our customers, have a conversation about what kind of coffee they liked, and how much they tended to drink, and, if it was a good conversation, we would take their credit card number and make them a promise: to drive to their homes once a week and drop coffee on their doorstep.<br><br>This turned out to be a fraught business model for a number of reasons—and besides, there is only so much coffee you can pack into your <span class="blue"> Peugeot 505 wagon</span>—but it is still, more or less, what we are trying to do.<br><br>We work directly with farmers around the world to source the most delicious and sustainable coffees we can find. Then, we roast them to our exacting flavor standards, and serve them to you at peak deliciousness, hopefully alongside a good conversation and some friendly advice. We think it’s a privilege to deliver the coffees we love, by farmers we admire, into your <span class="blue">hands</span> or onto your <span class="blue">doorstep</span>.</p>
