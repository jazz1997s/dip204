	<p class="introText">On Februrary 12, it is a new start for the four of us. Leaving everything else behind, we finally gotten our first own franchise coffee shop approval. As all of us still couldn't snap out of this dream sometimes ago, we still thought getting the warrant approval is impossible. But, it was just too true that we can finally succeed in our new life goal moreover so. Which is why to kickstart eveything, we spend a lot of effort in furnishing and decorating our first coffee shop hoping that it will be smoothly sail until a new checkpoint.

        <p class="introText">The first method of selling coffee we tried was enjoyable but <span class="blue">short-lived:</span><br><br>We would call our customers, have a conversation about what kind of coffee they liked, and how much they tended to drink, and, if it was a good conversation, we would take their credit card number and make them a promise: to drive to their homes once a week and drop coffee on their doorstep.<br><br>This turned out to be a fraught business model for a number of reasons—and besides, there is only so much coffee you can pack into your <span class="blue"> Peugeot 505 wagon</span>—but it is still, more or less, what we are trying to do.<br><br>We work directly with farmers around the world to source the most delicious and sustainable coffees we can find. Then, we roast them to our exacting flavor standards, and serve them to you at peak deliciousness, hopefully alongside a good conversation and some friendly advice. We think it’s a privilege to deliver the coffees we love, by farmers we admire, into your <span class="blue">hands</span> or onto your <span class="blue">doorstep</span>.</p>

  <h3>Espresso (Short Black)</h3>
	<p>The espresso (aka “short black”) is the foundation and the most important part to every espresso based drink. So much so that we’ve written a guide on how to make the perfect espresso shot. But for the purposes of this post an espresso consists of:<br><br>• 1 Shot of espresso in an espresso cup<br><br></p>
    <img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="doppio.jpg" alt="doppio">
    <h3>Double Espresso (Doppio)</h3>
<p>A double espresso (aka “Doppio”) is just that, two espresso shots in one cup. Therefore a double espresso consists of:<br><br><br>• 2 shots of espresso in an espresso cup<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="short macchiato.jpg" alt="short macchiato" style="margin-top: 45px;">
<h3>Short Macchiato</h3>
<p>A short macchiato is similar to an espresso but with a dollop of steamed milk and foam to mellow the harsh taste of an espresso. You will find that baristas in different countries make short macchiatos differently. However the traditional way of making a short macchiato is as follows:<br><br>• 1 Shot of espresso in a short glass or espresso cup<br>• A dollop of steamed milk and foam placed on top of the espresso<br><br>Barista tip: The key to the perfect short macchiato is the rule of thirds. That is you want three different colored layers in the macchiato. A bottom dark layer to <br>represent the espresso, a middle layer that mixes the espresso and the milk, and a top layer of predominantly steamed milk. Refer to the picture above as an<br>example.<br><br></p>
    <img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="long macchiato.jpg" alt="long macchiato" style="margin-top: 40px;">
<h3>Short Macchiato</h3>
<p>A long macchiato is the same as a short macchiato but with a double shot of espresso. The same rule of thirds applies in the traditionally made long macchiato:<br><br>• 2 shots of espresso in a tumbler glass or cup<br>• A dollop of steamed milk and foam placed on top of the espresso<br><br>Barista tip: The key to making the perfect three layers is to place the dollop of steamed milk and foam on top of the espresso and then gently turning the cup clockwise a few times to mix the milk and espresso.<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="ristretto.jpg" alt="ristretto" style="margin-top: 10px;">
<h3>Ristretto</h3>
<p>A ristretto is an espresso shot that is extracted with the same amount of coffee but half the amount of water. The end result is a more concentrated and darker espresso extraction. It is made as follows:<br><br>• Extract a standard espresso shot with half the amount of water.<br>• Alternatively turn off a normal espresso extraction before the espresso starts to blonde.<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="americano.jpg" alt="americano" style="margin-top: 25px;">
<h3>Long Black (Americano)</h3>
<p>A long black (aka “americano”) is hot water with an espresso shot extracted on top of the hot water. It is made as follows:<br><br>• Fill a cup with 2/3rds full of hot water<br>• Extract 1 shot of espresso over the hot water<br><br>Barista Tip: Make sure you back-wash your portafilter before making a long black, otherwise you might find grinds from your coffee grinder floating in your coffee.<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="cafe latte.jpg" alt="cafe latte" style="margin-top: 40px;">
<h3>Café Latte</h3>
<p>A café latte, or “latte” for short, is an espresso based drink with steamed milk and micro-foam added to the coffee. This coffee is much sweeter compared to an espresso due to the steamed milk. It is made as follows:<br><br>• Extract 1 shot of espresso into a tumbler glass<br>• Add steamed milk<br>• 1cm of micro-foam on top of the steamed milk<br><br>Barista tip: In the USA it is common to use a cup instead of a tumbler glass for a latte.<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="cappuccino.jpg" alt="cappuccino" style="margin-top: 35px;">
<h3>Cappuccino</h3>
<p>A cappuccino is similar to a latte. However the key difference between a latte and cappuccino is that a cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of the drink. Further a cappuccino is made in a cup rather than a tumbler glass. It is made as follows:<br><br>• Extract 1 shot of espresso into a cup<br>• Add steamed milk<br>• Add 2-3cm of micro-foam on top of the steamed milk<br>• Sprinkle chocolate on top of the coffee<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="flat white.jpg" alt="flat white" style="margin-top: 10px;">
<h3>Flat White</h3>
<p>A flat white is a coffee you’ll primarily find in Australia and New Zealand. It is made the same as a cappuccino expect it does not have any foam or chocolate on top. It is made like this:<br><br>• 1 shot of espresso into a cup<br>• Add steamed milk into the cup but no micro-foam<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="piccolo latte.jpg" alt="piccolo latte" style="margin-top: 10px;">
<h3>Piccolo Latte</h3>
<p>A piccolo latte is a café latte made in an espresso cup. This means it has a very strong but mellowed down espresso taste thanks to the steamed milk and micro foam within it. There are two ways of making a piccolo latte, with either 1 espresso shot or 1 ristretto shot:<br><br>• 1 shot of espresso or 1 ristretto shot of espresso in a espresso cup<br>• Add steamed milk and small amount of micro-foam.<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="mocha.jpg" alt="mocha" style="margin-top: 45px;">
<h3>Mocha</h3>
<p>A mocha is a mix between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. It is made by putting mixing chocolate powder with an espresso shot and then adding steamed milk and micro-foam into the beverage. The steps are as follows:<br><br>• Extract 1 shot of espresso into a cup<br>• Add one spoon of chocolate powder into the espresso shot and mix<br>• Add steamed milk<br>• Add 2-3cm of micro-foam<br>• Sprinkle chocolate powder on top<br><br></p>
<img class="coffeetypeThumb" src="affogato.jpg" alt="affogato" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h3>Affogato</h3>
<p>An affogato is a simple dessert coffee that is treat during summer and after dinner. It is made by placing one big scoope of vanilla ice cream within a single or double shot of espresso:<br><br>• Add one scoop of vanilla ice-cream into a tumbler glass milk<br>• Pour a single or double shot of espresso over the vanilla ice-cream<br><br>Barista Tip: If you feel like an irish kick add a shot of Frangelico liqueur into the mix.<br><br></p>

        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
	    <p><b>Measure the dose for enough amount for your portion.For adouble shot, grind between 18–21 grams of coffee into your basket. This would be the most familiar ways to make your nice expresso.</b></p>
		<center><img src="step3.3.jpg" alt="step 3" style="width:700px;height:400px;"></center>	
		<br><br>
		<h4>Step 4:</h4>
		<p><b>Holding Tamp with 90 degree angle. Tamp grounds firmly (using 30 lbs. of pressure). Next, press water button briefly to flush out stagnant water.</b></p>
		<center><img src="step4.png" alt="step 4" style="width:700px;height:400px;"></center>	
		<br><br>
		<h4>Step 5:</h4>
		<p><b>Place your portafilter on a clean, flat surface and position your tamper level on top of the grounds. Without driving your palm into the tamper’s base (which can cause gnarly wrist problems down the line), apply pressure downward. You don’t need to tamp incredibly hard—just enough to seal the coffee in evenly. Twenty to 30 pounds of pressure should do it. Give the tamper a gentle spin. This will smooth, or “polish,” the grounds for an even extraction.</b></p>
